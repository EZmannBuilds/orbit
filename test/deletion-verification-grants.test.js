// Orbit Axis :: post-deletion verification grants (Dev Update 1.2).
//
// A regression guard for a failure that was invisible in every other test.
//
// Account deletion verifies its own cascade by counting rows still carrying the
// deleted user's id, using the service-role key. `service_role` bypasses
// row-level security but NOT table-level GRANTs, and it had never been granted
// anything — so every verification query failed with 42501, findSurvivingRows
// reported all sixteen tables as `unknown`, and a completely successful
// deletion returned DELETION_INCOMPLETE telling the person to contact support.
//
// Unit tests could not catch it: they inject a fetch double, so the grant is
// never exercised. It only appeared against a real database.
//
// What CAN be checked cheaply, and is checked here, is the invariant that made
// it possible: the list of tables the code verifies must match the list of
// tables the migration grants. Adding a table to one without the other is the
// exact mistake that produced this bug.
